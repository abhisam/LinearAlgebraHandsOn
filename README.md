# LinearAlgebraHandsOn
This a hands-on based on a Databricks community cloud notebook using the Breeze library for linear algebra in Scala and Spark MLlib. The objective of this hands-on is to get you started with linear algebra in Scala and apply it in basic machine learning methods, namely principal component analysis and regularized regression. In order to make use of this notebook, you have to register at the free-of-charge Databricks community cloud and open the notebook using the following link:
