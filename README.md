# LinearAlgebraHandsOn
This a hands-on based on a [Databricks community cloud](https://community.cloud.databricks.com) notebook using the [*Breeze*](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/) library for linear algebra in Scala and Spark [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html). The objective of this hands-on is to, first, get you started with linear algebra in Scala and, second, apply these operations in order to implement basic machine learning methods, namely principal component and regularized regression analysis both directly in Breeze and using MLlib. In the last part of the notebook, I introduce parameter tuning using the MLlib tuning package. 

In order to make use of this notebook, you have to register at the free-of-charge Databricks community cloud and open the notebook using the following [link](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/8623654525287098/4373605817327958/8746817301327119/latest.html). Alternatively, you may browse through the html version of the notebook and replicate those parts of the hands-on which do not depend on Databricks data sets.
